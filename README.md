# Embedded Modules Collection

This repository contains a collection of self-written and reusable modules for embedded systems development. The goal is to build a personal library of clean, well-documented, and hardware-oriented C code that can be easily integrated into microcontroller-based projects.

## ✅ Purpose

- Build reusable, modular code for embedded systems
- Improve code quality and documentation over time
- Serve as a personal knowledge base and toolkit for future projects
- Showcase embedded development experience

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each module is stored in its own folder and contains:

- `module_name.h` — public API
- `module_name.c` — implementation
- `README.md` — usage instructions and description (optional)

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Language: C (C99 or later)
- Target: STM32, bare-metal systems, or similar microcontrollers
- Toolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc, PlatformIO, STM32CubeIDE, etc.

## 🧱 Module Examples

- `four_digit_seven_seg` — Control logic for a 4-digit 7-segment display using multiplexing

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and include the desired module(s) in your embedded project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TazmanS/embedded.git
